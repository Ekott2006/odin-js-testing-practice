# Testing Basics

## Project: Mastering TDD with Simple Functions

This project delves into the fundamentals of Test-Driven Development (TDD) by building a set of basic JavaScript functions and writing thorough unit tests for each using Jest, a popular testing framework. This approach ensures code quality, maintainability, and confidence in its correctness.

## Technologies

- JavaScript

## Tools

- Visual Studio Code (IDE)
- Git (version control)
- GitHub (collaboration platform)

## Outcomes

- **Practical TDD Experience:** Gained hands-on understanding of the TDD methodology by writing tests that drive the development process.
- **Solid Unit Testing:** Implemented unit tests using Jest to rigorously test individual functions, guaranteeing their reliability and behavior.
- **Effective Version Control:** Utilized Git for version management, tracking changes, and facilitating collaboration (if applicable).
- **GitHub Integration** (Optional): Leveraged GitHub as a platform for storing the project code, managing versions, and potentially deploying the code (if applicable).

## Key Learnings

- **Benefits of TDD:** (Expand on the benefits of TDD, e.g., improved code quality, reduced regression errors, increased developer confidence)
- **Jest Framework:** Gained proficiency in writing assertions and leveraging Jest's features for effective unit testing.
- **Git and GitHub Best Practices:** (If applicable, detail specific Git commands and GitHub workflows used)
